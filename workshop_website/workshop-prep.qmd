title: "How to prepare for this workshop"
---

Include a set of instructions for which software are required for this workshop. Primarily focused on the set of R packages that need to be installed, as well as a compiler tool for a specific OS (including R and optionally RStudio). This means pointing attendees to the websites they need to go to for downloading specialty software, such as Xcode, gfortran, etc.

Provide explicit instructions that attendees should attempt to install all software at least 2 days before the workshop. That way I can help if they run into issues and can't install or run some of the necessary R packages.
