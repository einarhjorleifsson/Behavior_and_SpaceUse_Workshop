> There can be issues getting compilers to work properly, especially on M1 Macs. Often, this is due to missing or incorrect Xcode Command Line Tools and/or Fortran compiler. If you encounter install and compile issues, you may find a solution in the excellent documentation here [glmmTMB](https://github.com/glmmTMB/glmmTMB).

Another good resource for `aniMotum`-specific technical problems is the ['Issues'](https://github.com/ianjonsen/aniMotum/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) page of the GitHub repo. For more information on installing this package, please refer to the installation instructions from the README on the `aniMotum` [website](https://ianjonsen.github.io/aniMotum/).
